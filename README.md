# Introduction

Welcome to the SQL Job Market Analysis Project! 

This project is designed to analyze job market trends by leveraging SQL to extract meaningful insights from job postings and skills data. It focuses on identifying top-paying jobs, highly demanded skills, and the optimal skill sets required for specific roles. By combining advanced SQL techniques such as **Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, aggregations, and window functions**, this project provides a comprehensive view of the job market landscape.

Whether you're a data scientist, recruiter, or someone exploring career opportunities, this project offers valuable insights to help you make informed decisions.


# Background

The job market is rapidly evolving, with new roles and skills emerging as industries adapt to technological advancements. Staying competitive requires understanding these trends, which is equally important for **job seekers**, **recruiters**, and **organizations**.

This project bridges the gap between job postings and actionable insights by analyzing real-world data to answer critical questions:
- **Which jobs offer the highest salaries?**
- **What skills are most in demand?**
- **How can job seekers align their skills with market needs?**

Using a dataset containing job postings, companies, salaries, and skills, this project applies **SQL** to uncover patterns and trends. While the focus is on roles like **Data Scientist**, the queries are adaptable for other roles, industries, or regions, making it a versatile tool for exploring the modern job market.

# Tools Used

For my deep dive into the data scientist job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The foundation of this project, enabling powerful querying and analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and reliable database management system, perfectly suited for handling and managing the job postings dataset.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A versatile and efficient code editor, used for writing and executing SQL queries with ease.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential tools for version control and collaboration, ensuring seamless tracking and sharing of SQL scripts and project progress.

# Analysis

Each query in this project was designed to explore specific aspects of the data scientist job market, providing targeted insights to answer key questions.

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To uncover the highest-paying roles, I analyzed data scientist positions by filtering based on average yearly salary and location, with a focus on opportunities in India. This query sheds light on lucrative job prospects within the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    JOB_TITLE_SHORT, NAME, SALARY_YEAR_AVG, JOB_LOCATION
FROM 
    COMPANY_DIM AS COMP 
LEFT JOIN JOB_POSTINGS_FACT AS JOB 
ON COMP.COMPANY_ID = JOB.COMPANY_ID
WHERE 
    SALARY_YEAR_AVG IS NOT NULL 
    AND JOB_TITLE_SHORT = 'Data Scientist' 
    AND JOB_LOCATION = 'India'  
ORDER BY 
    SALARY_YEAR_AVG DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs:
- GSK offers significantly higher compensation compared to other companies
- There's a cluster of companies offering around $170,000/year
- The difference between the highest and lowest salary in the top 10 is approximately $42,000/year
- Multiple companies appear twice in the list with slightly different salary ranges


### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To identify the skills needed for top-paying jobs, I joined job postings with skills data, uncovering what employers prioritize for high-salary roles.
```sql
-- temp1: extracts top-paying data scientist jobs in india, including job details and salary information
WITH temp1 AS (
    SELECT 
        job_id, job_title_short, name, job_location, salary_year_avg
    FROM 
        company_dim AS comp 
    LEFT JOIN job_postings_fact AS job 
    ON comp.company_id = job.company_id
    WHERE 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
        AND job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' 
        AND job_location = 'India'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

-- temp2: joins the job data from temp1 with skills data to identify skills associated with top-paying jobs
temp2 AS (
    SELECT 
        temp1.*, -- includes all columns from temp1
        skills, 
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY name) 
    FROM
        ((skills_job_dim 
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id)
        INNER JOIN temp1 ON skills_job_dim.job_id = temp1.job_id) 
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC 
)

-- final select: outputs the enriched dataset with job details, salary, and associated skills
SELECT * 
FROM 
    temp2;
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```


Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills 
for High-Paying Data Scientist Roles in India:
